# Drop-Animation
A repository about Drop Animation. More about it in ReadMe


This project generates a visually dynamic animation of drops appearing randomly on the screen, scaling and changing color as they animate.
Each drop lasts for a short duration before being removed, creating a lively effect. 
You can adjust timing, colors, and sizes by tweaking the CSS and JavaScript values!
